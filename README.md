<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### About The Project

I'm Oksana. I am a front-end developer from Belarus. I have learned HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Figma, Gsap, GitHub.
And now Iâ€™m looking for a job where I can put my skills into practice, where I can become part of a team and benefit the company.
I try to learn something new every day and now I am learning React.


This application is a list of desired gifts. Gifts are displayed in the photo, and when you click on the remove button, they are removed from the list one by one. When you click on the Delete all button, everything is deleted at once.

I used a functional component - the useState hook. 
This application also uses the filter() and map() methods.

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
